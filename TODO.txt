Things left to do:

test      Player.SetUpShips
write     Board.UpdateHitsMisses
test/fix  Board.UpdateShipPositions
write     Player.Attack
write     Game.PlayGame

untested (but small) functions
Ship.CheckIfSunk
Ship.UpdateNoseAndTail
Player.CheckIfNoRemainingShips
Player.MoveShipsToDefaultLocations

Player.ShipsOverlap has not been tested with Player.SetUpShips

HUGE BUG????
fixed, kind of. Board stores stuff as (y, x). Is there a way to fix this??? Is probably iportant to stay true to conventions (all (y, x) or all (x, y)) to avoid confusion.
	Ships should initialized as vertical, but are displayed as horizontal. Down is right, Right is down, Left is probably up, Up is probably left.
